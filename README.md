# 2020ScoutingApp
## To Do List
- Auto: make "init. line crossed" toggle, add indicator that auto is auto
- TeleOp: change the coloring of attempted/successful control to be less confusing, add reason why pos. control failed for teleOp, add indicator
- Both: add "missed upper" button to determine accuracy objectively
- Notes: change the dialogs. make defense (n/a, good) and see if it defended or faced defense; also check if 1) beam is balanced and 2) robot strafed to hang. get rid of deployment accuracy because that info is already given
